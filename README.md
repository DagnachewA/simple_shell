0x16. C - Simple Shell
Group project Batch 20

Background Context
Write a simple UNIX command interpreter.

Gates of Shell

Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell

man or help: sh (Run sh as well)

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
Who is Ken Thompson
How does a shell work
What is a pid and a ppid
How to manipulate the environment of the current process
What is the difference between a function and a system call
How to create processes
What are the three prototypes of main
How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
How to execute another program with the execve system call
How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
Requirements
General
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project with the description of your project
Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository
GitHub
*There should be one project repository per group. Add your partner as a collaborator.

Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.

The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)

Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

wait4 (man 2 wait4)
write (man 2 write)
Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way: *gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 .c -o hsh

Testing
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
TASKS
betty would be proud
Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks
Simple shell 0.1
Write a UNIX command line interpreter
Simple shell 0.2
Handle command lines with arguments
Simple shell 0.3
Handle the PATH
fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist
Simple shell 0.4
Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
Usage: exit
You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit
Simple shell 1.0
Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
Simple shell 0.1.1
Write your own getline function
Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call
You will need to use static variables
You are not allowed to use getline
Simple shell 0.2.1
You are not allowed to use strtok
Simple shell 0.4.1
handle arguments for the built-in exit
Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell
setenv, unsetenv
Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
setenv

Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
unsetenv

Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE
cd
Implement the builtin command cd
Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
